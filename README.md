# Solve_of_SLAE
Solution of the simultaneous linear algebraic equations via direct methods (QR-solve and Gauss method) and iteration method (simple iteration, Jacoby method, Zeydel method, over- and under-relaxation method). Also added is a laboratory work on finding natural numbers, interpolation, numerical solution of ordinary differential equations, solution of the wave equation and the heat equation.

In two files there is the same class with identical functions for operations with matrices. The only difference are methods for solving SLAE.
