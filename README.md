# Solve_of_SLAE
Solution of the simultaneous linear algebraic equations via direct methods (QR-solve and Gauss method) and iteration method (simple iteration, Jacoby method, Zeydel method, over- and under-relaxation method).

In two files there is the same class with identical functions for operations with matrices. The only difference are methods for solving SLAE.
